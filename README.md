## Introduction

### bcdata and bcmaps R packages

The `bcdata` and `bcmaps` packages now provide an easy way to query,
download and visualize some BC government datasets through the R
interface. This short vignette will demonstrate a few ways that we can
do this using RESULTS and other datasets. These packages have been
developed by Andy Teucher, Sam Albers, Stephanie Hazlitt and others, and
more information can be found here: <https://bcgov.github.io/bcdata/>

While BC government data can be downloaded through your browser at
www.catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca, I think there are some advantages to using
the `bcdata` package to download data from within R:

1.  You are not limited to download limits;
2.  You can query the data before downloading to extract only what you
    need;
3.  After downloading, you can quickly work with the data in R; and
4.  Development team is very responsive and great to work with\!

## Getting started

First thing we need to do is make sure we have some packages installed.
If you don’t have the package already installed on your machine, run the
following code to install from CRAN:

``` r
# Install bcdata from CRAN
install.packages("bcdata")

# Install bcmaps from CRAN
install.packages("bcmaps")
```

To start the demo, let’s load some other libraries:

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(bcdata)
library(mapview)
library(bcmaps)
library(bcmapsdata)
library(here)
```

### Different ways to use the bcdata package

The main functions in `bcdata` are:

1.  bcdc\_browse() - Open the catalogue in your default browser
2.  bcdc\_search() - Search records in the catalogue
3.  bcdc\_search\_facets() - List catalogue facet search options
4.  bcdc\_get\_record() - Print a catalogue record
5.  bcdc\_get\_data() - Get catalogue data
6.  bcdc\_query\_geodata() - Get & query catalogue geospatial data
    available through a Web Service

In general, I use an iterative workflow with these packages:

1.  Search for datasets in the catalogue;
2.  Query the dataset to understand the data structure;
3.  Filter for records of interest; and
4.  Download the data into R

<!-- end list -->

``` r
bcdc_search("hydrology")
```

    ## Found 101 matches. Returning the first 100.
    ## To see them all, rerun the search and set the 'n' argument to 101.

Records with *wms* are spatial files that can be queried and downloaded
using `bcdc_query_geodata`.

### Silviculture data in BC

Silviculture information in BC is largely collected and tracked through
the RESULTS database (Reporting Silviculture Updates and Land Status
Tracking System). The database stores silviculture-related information
on the management of openings, disturbances, silviculture activities and
obligation declarations as required by the Forest and Range Practices
Act. Data in RESULTS are publically available through
catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca. More information on RESULTS can be found here:
<https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/forestry/managing-our-forest-resources/silviculture/silviculture-reporting-results>

## Application of bcdata and bcmaps to RESULTS data

### Reforestation with climate considerations in the Prince George District

The Omineca Region’s Climate Action Plan has targets around
reforestation with tree species that will likely remain well-adapted to
projected future climates. Douglas-fir and western larch have been
identified as tree species that will remain viable into the future.

*Question: how much western larch is being planted in the Prince George
District?*

We can gather information to answer this question using RESULTS -
silviculture forest cover dataset. First, let’s take a look at the
dataset contents using
    `bcdc_query_geodata`:

``` r
bcdc_query_geodata("results-forest-cover-silviculture") 
```

    ## Warning: It is advised to use the permanent id ('258bb088-4113-47b1-b568-ce20bd64e3e3') rather than the name of the record ('results-forest-cover-silviculture') to guard against future name changes.

    ## Querying 'results-forest-cover-silviculture' record
    ## * Using collect() on this object will return 867077 features and 159 fields
    ## * At most six rows of the record are printed here

The output from this query shows that this dataset has 866,728 features
and 159 fields. Each feature is a treatment unit within a harvested
opening, and contains information on the leading five tree species that
are present in each treatment unit, including stems per hectare, age,
and height.

This dataset would be too large (\~1GB) to download efficiently. So,
let’s use `filter` to refine our query:

1.  Filter openings that are in Prince George District; and
2.  Filter treatment units that have Douglas-fir or western larch
    present.

First, let’s filter for openings in the PG District. We’ll use `bcdata`
package to do this by downloading a shapefile for the PG District and
use that as a bounding box:

``` r
# First, let's take a look at the natural resource district dataset
bcdc_query_geodata("natural-resource-nr-district")
```

    ## Querying 'natural-resource-nr-district' record
    ## * Using collect() on this object will return 23 features and 12 fields
    ## * At most six rows of the record are printed here

We can see that there are 23 NR districts in the province. District
codes are stored in the ‘ORG\_UNIT’ column Let’s filter districts for
DPG (Prince George) and download it as a shapefile.

``` r
dpg<-  # Create new spatial feature called dpg
  bcdc_query_geodata("natural-resource-nr-district") %>%  # query the nr district dataset 
  filter(ORG_UNIT=="DPG") %>% # filter for Prince George District
  collect() # and download it 

# Alternatively, load from workspace
# load(here("data","dpg.RData"))
```

This is a small file, and shouldn’t take long to download. We can plot
it to double check:

``` r
dpg %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_sf()
```

![](README_files/figure-gfm/plot%20DPG-1.png)<!-- -->

Now we have a shapefile that we can use as a bounding box to filter and
download records in the RESULTS - silviculture layer. We’ll just
download openings that have larch planted, to make for a smaller file
size.

*Note: the chunk below can take a minute or so to run. To save time,
I’ve already run the chunk and saved the output to an .RData file,
which we’ll load into our workspace in a subsequent chunk*

``` r
# First, let's list what tree species we are interested in
 sppList=c("LW")
 
# Now let's filter the records and download the data

  treesDPG<- # create new spaial feature by
    
    bcdc_query_geodata("results-forest-cover-silviculture") %>% # querying the results silviculture layer and
   
    filter(INTERSECTS(dpg)) %>% # filter for records that are within the DPG and
    
    filter(S_SPECIES_CODE_1 %in% sppList| # filter for our species within any of the five species per TU
            S_SPECIES_CODE_2 %in% sppList|
            S_SPECIES_CODE_3 %in% sppList|
            S_SPECIES_CODE_4 %in% sppList|
            S_SPECIES_CODE_5 %in% sppList) %>% 
    
    collect() # and download the file
```

Let’s load this dataset into our workspace:

``` r
load(here("data","treesDPG.RData"))

dim(treesDPG)
```

    ## [1] 169 162

There are 169 treatment units planted with larch in DPG.

Now we can plot the openings and see how things
look:

``` r
mapview(treesDPG,zcol="S_SILV_LABEL",legend=FALSE)+dpg
```

![](README_files/figure-gfm/map%20larch%20plantations%20in%20DPG-1.png)<!-- -->

### Summaries

We can also create some quick summaries of the data, treating the
attribute table as a data frame in R:

#### Question: what is the age distribution of larch plantations in DPG?

``` r
treesDPG %>% 
  st_drop_geometry() %>% # drop geometry, likel not necessary
  mutate(age=2020-REFERENCE_YEAR+S_SPECIES_AGE_1) %>% # create an age column

  # plotting
  ggplot()+
  aes(x=age,y=FEATURE_AREA_SQM/10000)+
  geom_bar(stat="sum")+
  ylab("Sum treatment unit area (ha)")+
  theme(legend.position="none")+
  scale_x_continuous(name="Stand age", limits=c(2,30),
                     breaks=seq(from=5,to=30,by=5))+
  ggtitle("Area planted with larch by age in DPG, as of 2020")
```

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)<!-- -->

#### Where are the older larch plantations in DPG?

``` r
treesDPG %>% 
  mutate(age=2020-REFERENCE_YEAR+S_SPECIES_AGE_1+1) %>% # create age column
  filter(age>20) %>% # filter for stand ages older than 20
  mapview(zcol="age") # map
```

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)<!-- -->

#### Question: what is the BEC distribution of larch plantations in DPG?

The `bcmaps` package contains BEC spatial data, which can be used to
look at larch distribution by BGC unit in DPG. BEC data are loaded into
the workspace using the `bec()` function, and then can be joined to an
existing dataset using the `st_join` function. This takes awhile, so I
did it beforehand.

``` r
# First, load BEC data into your workspace 
 becData<-bec() 

# Now join with dataset
treesDPG<-  # update spatial feature 

    st_join(treesDPG,bgcPG[,"MAP_LABEL"]) # join BEC data for each polygon
```

Let’s map blocks by BGC unit:

``` r
mapview(treesDPG,zcol="MAP_LABEL")
```

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)<!-- -->

#### Summarize area planted with larch by BGC unit

``` r
treesDPG %>% 
  st_drop_geometry() %>% # drop geometry
  group_by(MAP_LABEL) %>% # group polygons by BGC unit
  summarise(Area=sum(FEATURE_AREA_SQM)/10000) %>% 
 
   # plotting
  ggplot()+
  aes(x=MAP_LABEL,y=Area)+
  geom_bar(stat="Identity")+
  ylab("Sum treatment unit area (ha)")+
  theme(legend.position="none")+
  ggtitle("Area planted with larch by BGC unit in DPG")+
  xlab("BGC unit")
```
